Hume Media Library
----------------------

The Hume Media Library is a collectioni of common classes used to build
simple media programs (largely games). It is written in C++, using SDL
for cross-platform compatibility.

Building the library requires the following development libraries to be
installed on your system in some form:

SDL2
SDL2_ttf
SDL2_image
SDL2_mixer

If you are running Linux, these packages can almost certainly be obtained
through your distribution's package manager. I have included a trivial build
script to help archive the project into a static library. It is located in
the 'src' folder.

If you are running Mac OS X, the frameworks must be obtained from the SDL
website. The .framework packages should be placed in the /Library/Frameworks
folder. Follow the readme included with each framework and you should be fine.
To set up the project in Xcode, first create the project, initialize the Git
repository in the project folder, add the remote and then pull the files.

Alternatively, you can use the Homebrew package manager to install the
libraries as well.

If you are running Windows, I recommend using MinGW. Obtain the files from
the SDL website and place the libs and headers in their respective places. Then,
if using an IDE, configure it to link with these libraries.
