Hume Game Library
----------------------

The Hume Game Library is a collection of commonly used classes seen in 
game programming. It provides a means of lessening the time spent on 
programming in order speed up the creation of great 2D games. It is 
written in C++ for performance using Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) for 
cross-platform compatibility.

Building the library requires the following development libraries to be
installed on your system:

sdl
sdl_ttf
sdl_image
sdl_mixer

If you are running Linux or Mac OS X, there is a build script included to
automate the process of compiling the code into a static library. If the
script fails, please double-check that you have the development libraries
installed on your system. If you still have a problem, feel free to contact
me by my email.
