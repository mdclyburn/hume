Hume Game Library
----------------------

Project is a library of commonly used objects for purely 2D
games. It is built using C++ and SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) for
low level access to hardware and cross-platform compatibility.

As I advance my skills with game programming, this library
will definitely grow as reuseable modules are created.
