Hume Game Library
----------------------

The Hume Game Library is a collection of commonly used classes seen in 
game programming. It provides a means of lessening the time spent on 
programming in order speed up the creation of great 2D games. It is 
written in C++ for performance using Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) for 
cross-platform compatibility.

Building the library requires the following development libraries to be
installed on your system in some form:

sdl
sdl_ttf
sdl_image
sdl_mixer

If you are running Linux, these packages can almost certainly be obtained
through your distribution's package manager. I have included a trivial build
script to help archive the project into a static library. It is located in
the 'src' folder.

If you are running Mac OS X, the frameworks must be obtained from the SDL
website. The .framework packages should be placed in the /Library/Frameworks
folder. Follow the readme included with each framework and you should be fine.
To set up the project in Xcode, first create the project, initialize the Git
repository in the project folder, add the remote and then pull the files.

If you are running Windows, I recommend using MinGW. Obtain the files from
the SDL website and place the libs and headers in their respective places. Then,
if using an IDE, configure it to link with these libraries.
